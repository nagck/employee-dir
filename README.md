# Employee Directory (React Assignment)
## Description
This Employee Directory application was created with React. The application allows a user to view entire employee directory at once so that the user has quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. The user is also able to filter employees by name or sort in alphabetical order.

The application's UI has been split into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees will be rendered. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by different category

  * Filter the users by different property

## Technologies Used: 
* React Libray
* Node.js, Express
* JavaScript, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap
* npm
* Axios API
* Random User Generator API
